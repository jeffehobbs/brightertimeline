To deploy:

1) Get API Keys for the NewsAPI, Mercury Reader API, and create a Facebook app and get the API keys.

2) Place those API keys in the "apikeys.txt" file.

3) Install additional python libraries, I suggest via pip: requests, requests_cache, arrow. (Use a venv, you animal.)

4) Run the "engine.py" file ("python engine.py"). 

5) This will generate a set of .json files in the /data directory that contain metadata read by index.html.

  5a) Run "engine.py" on a timed schedule to keep your news up to date. Be mindful of API call limits!

6) Play with the parameters in "engine.py" to create your own set of aggregated/filtered news!
