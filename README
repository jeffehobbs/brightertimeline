TO DEPLOY
---

1) Get API keys for the NewsAPI, Mercury Reader API, create a Facebook app and get the FB app's API keys.

2) Place those API keys in the "apikeys.txt" file.

3) Install additional python libraries: requests, requests_cache, arrow. (Use a venv, you animal.)

4) Run the "engine.py" file. This will generate a set of .json files in the /data directory read by index.html.

6) Run "engine.py" on a timed schedule to keep your news up to date. Be mindful of API call limits!

7) Play with the parameters in "engine.py" and customize "index.html" to create your own set of aggregated/filtered news!
