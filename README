To deploy:

1) Get API Keys for the NewsAPI, Mercury Reader API, and create a Facebook app and get the API keys.

2) Place those API keys in the "apikeys.txt" file.

3) Install additional python libraries (I suggest via pip): requests, requests_cache, arrow.

4) Run the "engine.py" file ("python engine.py"). 

5) This will generate a set of .json files in the /data directory that contain metadata read by index.html.

6) Play with the parameters to create your own set of aggregated/filtered news!
